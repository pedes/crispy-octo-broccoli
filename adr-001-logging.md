# ADR 001: Logging Management Strategy

## Context

Creating effective logging management practices for mule applications in cloud environments is essential for ensuring system reliability, performance, and security. This involves strategic planning, tool selection, and the implementation of best practices that address distributed systems' unique challenges.

## Decision

- Centralization of Logs: Your mule applications are distributed across various VMs/containers and environments. Centralizing logs makes it easier to search, analyze, and monitor the logs cohesively. Consider using Anypoint Monitoring (Titanium) or an external log aggregation system (tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or AWS CloudWatch Logs for centralizing and managing logs).
- Standardized Log Format: Adopt a standardized log format (e.g., JSON) across all APIs to simplify parsing and analysis. Include key data points such as timestamps, service identifiers, and log levels. Could use JSON Layout and different appenders from Log4j.
- Log Levels and Verbosity: Define clear guidelines for log levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, etc.) and ensure developers understand which level to use for different types of events. This will help them filter logs for relevant information during troubleshooting.
- Security and Compliance: Be mindful of logging sensitive information. Implement measures to anonymize or encrypt sensitive data in logs. Also, ensure your logging practices comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Retention Policies and Archiving: Establish log retention policies based on storage capacity, cost, and compliance requirements. Implement log rotation and archiving strategies to manage old logs efficiently.
- Performance Considerations: Ensure that logging does not significantly impact the performance of your Mule Apps/APIs. Use asynchronous logging (that's the default) and consider the impact of logging at various verbosity levels.
- Real-time Monitoring and Alerting: Leverage log data for real-time monitoring and set up alerts for anomalies or specific error patterns to quickly identify and address issues. Could even use AI to analyze log patterns actively and identify anomalies.
- Review and Adjust: Regularly review your logging practices and configurations. Adapt as your application and infrastructure evolve.
